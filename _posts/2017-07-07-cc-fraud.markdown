Today was fun. It is payday! Unfortunately, woke up to login to my bank account and I see a $599.99 charge for B&H Photo in NYC. Banks are so slow nowadays that they need to wait for the transaction to post, then can proceed to cancel it. I have been given the timeframe of up to ten business days for money to be credited back to my account.

I think from now on, I will need to use prepaid credit cards when doing any form of online transactions. It is such an inconvenience when the card that is breached is the one tied to a bank account. Having a prepaid card loaded up with some cash can combat this, and if the card ever is breached...it won't be as big of an impact.
