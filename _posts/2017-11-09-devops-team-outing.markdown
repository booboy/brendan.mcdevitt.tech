I had alot of fun tonight with my new co-workers! I am part of the devops team at Narrative Science. We went out tonight for a team outing. It was axe throwing! That was the first time 
I have ever done something like that. I struggled in the beginning, but got a little bit better towards the end. Some of my teammates were absolutely
incredible at it! Here is a pic of the entire team! It was lots of fun, would
do it again in a heartbeat!
