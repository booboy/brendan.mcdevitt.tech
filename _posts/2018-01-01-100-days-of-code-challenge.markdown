With a brand new year, comes a fresh start, a clean slate. I am going to begin
my new year with something I have just come across: [100daysofcode](http://100daysofcode.com/) challenge. 
I have forked the 100 days of code repo from github and am using the log to
track my daily progress. It will be fun, and it will be a great way to keep me
accountable for building my python knowledge.
