I walked almost 5 miles today throughout downtown Chicago. On my way back, I
cut through the Lincoln Park Zoo parking lot. They have something going on
right now during Halloween season titled 'Fall Fest' where they have some
different carnival rides at the Zoo. The Zoo was closed at the time I was
walking home, but I still felt the need to snap this picture of the Ferris
Wheel. It almost looks haunted.
