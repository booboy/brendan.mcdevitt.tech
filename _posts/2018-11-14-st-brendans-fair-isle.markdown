St. Brendan's Fair Isle 

         D                         G          D
When I was a lad on the Emerald Isle,
   G            D                       Bm
I heard many stories both lovely and wild.
  D                             G               D
About the great dragons and monsters there be,
        G            D                         Bm
That swallow the ships when they sail on the sea.
       G
Now, I was an artist with canvas and paints,
                                                 D
We sailed with Brendan and his jolly saints.
      G
We bid the good people farewell for a while.
       D                      A              D         G
We sailed to Saint Brendan's fair isle, fair isle,
       D                      A              D
We sailed to Saint Brendan's fair isle.

We'd been on the ocean for ninety-five days,
When we came to a spot where the sea was ablaze.
Those demons from Hades was dancing with glee,
And burning the sailors alive on the sea.
Saint Brendan walked on the blistering waves,
And he threw all the demons back down to their caves,
And all of the saints wore a heavenly smile,
We sailed...

One night while the brethren were lying asleep,
Well, a great dragon came up from out of the deep.
He thundered and he lightninged and he made a great din;
He woke up Saint Brendan and all of his men.
The dragon came on with his mouth open wide.
We threw in a cross and the great dragon died.
We plucked him and skinned him and feasted awhile,
We sailed...

Then at last we came onto that beautiful land.
We all went ashore and we walked on the strand.
We took our longbows and killed one pig or two
Then we roasted them up and had hot barbecue.
And after a while we were singing this song,
We noticed that the island was moving along.
We ate and we drank and we rode in high style,
We sailed...

Says Brendan, "Me boys, it is much to my wish
For to ride on the back of the world's biggest fish!
Hold fast to the rope that is pulling the ship,
For we'll need it some day if this fish takes a dip!"
We sailed every ocean, we sailed every sea,
We sailed every spot where a sailor could be.
In forty-four days we sailed ten million miles,
We sailed...
