# 100 Days of Code

### Day 5:
Today I did not have the energy to do anything with my discord bot. I will work
on that tomorrow and sunday. I mainly just did some hacker rank problems
involving strings. Here is a post someone on hacker rank who is much more
clever than me for validating any characters in strings:

```python
str = raw_input()
print any(c.isalnum()  for c in str)
print any(c.isalpha() for c in str)
print any(c.isdigit() for c in str)
print any(c.islower() for c in str)
print any(c.isupper() for c in str)
```

that will return True or False if ANY of the characters contain alphanumberic,
alphabetical, a digit, lowercase, or uppercase. A nice little shortcut that I
will remember.
