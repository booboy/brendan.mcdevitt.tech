# 100 Days of Code

### Day 4:
Today I worked on some more unit tests with a program I am building at work. I
learned a good deal about unit test calls and the different assert options you
can pass. I also looked further into the discord python library and copied some of the
example bots into an examples directory in my repo. I will need to experiment
further with those and look up more information on asyncio and how to properly
use it.
