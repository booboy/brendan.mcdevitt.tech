# 100 Days of Code

### Day 8:
I installed the [xonsh](http://xon.sh/) shell on my home system after a
co-worker introduced me to it earlier today. I am going to be experimenting with it all night
and configuring it with runtime configs and importing my bash aliases and
functions. This is a really cool shell that will help me accelerate how quickly
I learn core skills of python. It's like Ipython and bash had a baby! I am in!
