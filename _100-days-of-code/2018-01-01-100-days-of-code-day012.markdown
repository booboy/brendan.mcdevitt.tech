# 100 Days of Code

### Day 12:
Today I made basic aws scripts that interact with ec2 and s3. I am going to look
into designing programs that will migrate my existing OVH vps using a
combination of the API they provide, unix tools like rsync, and the AWS API. I
need to get better at interacting with boto3 so this will be perfect.
interacting with API's is fun and I really enjoy working with the HTTP
protocol. I also made a cronjob on my vps that will run a git pull of my
brendan.mcdevitt.tech repo, and jekyll is in watch mode so it will always stay
up to date as long as I am pushing to git.
