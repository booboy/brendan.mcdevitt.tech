# 100 Days of Code

With a brand new year, comes a fresh start, a clean slate. I am going to begin
my new year with something I have just come across: [100daysofcode](http://100daysofcode.com/) challenge. 
I have forked the 100 days of code repo from github and am using the log to
track my daily progress. It will be fun, and it will be a great way to keep me
accountable for building my python knowledge. Here is an example snippet from
the code I did for day 1.

### Day 1:
{% highlight python %}

def gen_ssh_keypair():
    """ Generate an RSA private / public keypair """
    key = RSA.generate(2048)

    # generate private key - output to file
    with open('rsa_privkey.pem', 'wb') as privkey:
        privkey.write(key.exportKey())

    # generate public key - output to file
    with open('rsa_pubkey.pem', 'wb') as pubkey:
        pubkey.write(key.publickey().exportKey())

    return 0
    
{% endhighlight %}
