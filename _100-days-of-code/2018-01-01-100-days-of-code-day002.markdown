# 100 Days of Code

### Day 2:
Today we are going to make a Discord chat bot. Bots have always been
interesting to me.
Trying to make a computer program behave like a human sounds like a fun
challenge, and a great way to play some fun pranks on my friends on Discord.
So far, I have sketched up the initial framework in my python program using the
discordpy library. I will need to learn more about the following:
- asyncio
- coroutines
These seem to be two main concepts that this library uses, and it will help aid
my skills in the future when making programs that focus on performance.
